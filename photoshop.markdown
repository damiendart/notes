Cleaning up Line-art in Photoshop
---------------------------------

  1. Open up the scanned inked artwork and use _Levels_ and _Threshold_
     adjustment layer to improve the line quality and whites.
  2. At the bottom of the _Channels_ palette, click on _Load channel as
     selection_ to create a selection of the white areas of the image.
  3. Invert the selection and on a new transparent layer fill the
     selection black.
  4. Deselect the selection and delete the original scanned line-art.
  5. Change the image mode to either RGB or CMYK, if necessary.
