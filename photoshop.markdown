Preparing Pencil Artwork for Inking in Photoshop
------------------------------------------------

  1. Open up the scanned pencil artwork in Photoshop and use a _Levels_
     adjustment layer to improve the line quality and whites.
  2. Clean up the artwork with white on a separate layer, if necessary.
  3. Convert the image to grayscale (using the _Mode_ menu found in the
     _Image_ menu) and then to monotone using 20% cyan as the primary
     ink. The shade of cyan used might depend on personal preference
     and printer output.


Cleaning up Line-art in Photoshop
---------------------------------

  1. Clean up the scanned inked artwork in Photoshop with adjustment
     layers:
     -  Remove any non-repro blue underdrawings with a _Hue/Saturation_
        adjustment layer. After choosing the _Cyans_ colour range in the
        _Properties_ panel, set the saturation to minimimum and the
        lightness to maximum.
     -  Use a _Levels_ adjustment layer to improve the line quality and
        whites, and to remove any remaining underdrawings.
  2. At the bottom of the _Channels_ palette, click on _Load channel as
     selection_ to create a selection of the white areas of the image.
  3. Invert the selection and on a new transparent layer fill the
     selection black.
  4. Deselect the selection and delete the original scanned line-art.
  5. Change the image mode to either RGB or CMYK, if necessary.
