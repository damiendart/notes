Creating Custom Photoshop Brushes
---------------------------------

The following recipe will give you a basic Photoshop brush that's a
little better than the presets for colouring and line-art.

  - Select the _Hard Round Pressure Size_ brush preset to start with.
  - In the _Brush Tip Shape_ panel:
    - Set the roundness to 75%,
    - hardness to 100%, and
    - the spacing to 1%.
  - In the _Shape Dynamics_ panel:
    - Set the minimum diameter to 20%, and
    - set the angle jitter to be determined by the direction.
  - In the _Texture_ panel:
    - Set the texture to anything, it doesn't matter.
    - Then set the scale to 100%,
    - ensure _Texture Each Tip_ is enabled and the mode is set to
      _Height_, and
    - set the depth to 100%.
  - Ensure _Smoothing_ is enabled.

I mainly use this brush at size 45 when drawing on an A4-sized document.
