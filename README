Damien's Notes
==============

A bunch of notes about stuff and a janky publish-to-HTML script.

After installing [UglifyJS][1] and any Ruby dependencies (see the
_Gemfile_), generating HTML versions of my notes is a simple `rake`
command away. See _Rakefile_ for information on the note format.

I've put the HTML versions of my notes up on [my personal site][2].

The script and accompanying template files are free and unencumbered
software released into the public domain (see the accompanying
"UNLICENCE" file for more information) and the notes are licensed under
a [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License][3].
