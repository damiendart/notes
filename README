Damien's Notes
==============

A bunch of notes about stuff and a janky publish-to-HTML script.

After [globally][1] installing [html-minifier][2] and [UglifyJS][3], and
fetching the necessary Ruby dependencies (see _Gemfile_), generating
HTML versions of my notes is a `rake` command away. See _Rakefile_ for
information on the note format.

I've put the HTML versions of my notes up on [my personal site][4].

The script and accompanying template files are free and unencumbered
software released into the public domain (see the accompanying
"UNLICENCE" file for more information) and the notes are licensed under
a [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License][5].
