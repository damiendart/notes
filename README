Damien's Notes
==============

A bunch of notes about stuff and a janky publish-to-HTML script.

After installing any dependencies with `bundle install`, generating HTML
versions of my notes is a simple `rake` command away. Someday I'll get
round to documenting the note format.

I've put the HTML versions of my notes up on [my personal site][1].
