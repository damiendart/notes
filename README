Damien's Notes
==============

A bunch of notes about stuff and a janky publish-to-HTML script.

You'll most likely want just the Markdown files; everything else is
mainly for my own benefit and allows me to publish HTML versions of my
notes on [my personal website][1].

If, for whatever reason, you want to play around with the janky
publish-to-HTML thing: fetch the necessary JavaScript and Ruby
dependencies (see _package.json_ and _Gemfile_), and then run `rake` to
generate HTML versions of my notes. See _Rakefile_ for information on
the note format. 

The script and accompanying template files are free and unencumbered
software released into the public domain (see the accompanying
"UNLICENCE" file for more information) and the notes are licensed under
a [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License][2].
