Damien's Notes
==============

A bunch of notes about stuff and a janky publish-to-HTML script.

After installing [html-minifier][1], [UglifyJS][2], and any Ruby
dependencies (see _Gemfile_), generating HTML versions of my notes is a
`rake` command away. See _Rakefile_ for information on the note format.

I've put the HTML versions of my notes up on [my personal site][3].

The script and accompanying template files are free and unencumbered
software released into the public domain (see the accompanying
"UNLICENCE" file for more information) and the notes are licensed under
a [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License][4].
