Damien's Notes
==============

A bunch of notes about stuff and a janky publish-to-HTML script.

You'll most likely want just the Markdown files; everything else is
mainly for my own benefit and allows me to publish HTML versions of my
notes on [my personal website][1].

If, for whatever reason, you want to play around with the janky
publish-to-HTML thing: [globally][2] install [html-minifier][3] and
[UglifyJS][4], fetch the necessary Ruby dependencies (see _Gemfile_),
and then run `rake` to generate HTML versions of my notes. See
_Rakefile_ for information on the note format.
