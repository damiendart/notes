Adobe Illustrator Notes
=======================


Things I constantly forget to do
--------------------------------

  - Check the document colour mode is set correctly.
  - Occasionally run the _Delete Unused Panel Items_ action (located in
    the _Default Actions_ folder) to keep document filesizes in check.
