Setting up an Windows 10 install
--------------------------------

  - To get a user profile folder that isn't named after your Microsoft
    account email address, create a local account when doing the
    first-time setup and then link your Microsoft account afterwards.
  - Applications I install:
    - [1Password][3];
    - [Creative Cloud][4] for Bridge, Photoshop, and Illustrator;
    - [Lazy Nezemi Pro][5], to make drawing in Photoshop less crap;
    - [Bash for Windows][6] (see _Bash for Windows bits and pieces_);
    - [Spotify][7];
    - [Chrome][8] along the with [1Password][9] and [Reddit Enhancement
      Suite][10] extensions;
    - [Firefox][11], for testing web stuff;
    - [Steam][12];
    - [Visual Studio 15][13]; and
    - [VueScan][14], only because the stock scanning interface on my
      previous system went to shit after a random update (I might not
      need this anymore).
  - Applications I put in a _bin_ folder in my user profile folder:
    [FlippyWindow][15] (once I've compiled it), [gVim][16],
    [ngrok][17], and [PuTTY][18].
  - Applications I don't need or use anymore:
    - [f.lux][19], as there's a similar built-in feature called Night
      Light that appeared with the Creators Update; and
    - [Geforce Experience][20].
